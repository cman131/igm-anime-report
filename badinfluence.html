		<h1 id='title'>Negative Effects From Anime</h1>
		<p class='content-block'>
Unfortunately, there is also a negative side to the influence anime has on people.
Not everyone reacts the same way to any shared interest, but there have been some
particularly bad effects that can be attributed to being a fan of anime. One of them
is not really bad at all, which is otaku culture. This is in no way a negative thing.
This is a vast group of people who love something and enjoy discussing and promoting it.
In fact, the base definition of an otaku is “people with a [highly] evolved sense of sight” (LaMarre, 2009, p. 144).
This was based on the ability to find and praise feats of small subsets of the anime staff.
An example would be discerning the work of a key animator from that of an in-between animator (LaMarre, 2009, p. 144).
This leads to an appreciation that anime staff can take pride in. Now the actual negative side
of otaku culture is the view of it from a non-otaku. It has been associated with being a loser or
geek interest. People have been bullied and looked down on for having such an interest, but luckily
this isn’t as common anymore. The spike in popularity from the 90s has set anime and manga
on a course to being mainstream like video-games have become.

One of the reasons for the negative viewpoint on otaku culture is the people who react in
unfortunate ways to their love of anime. Primary examples of this are hikikomori, 2D lovers,
and lolicon. One of those stands out as being worse for being associated with pedophilia and
that is lolicon. In anime it is surprisingly common for underage sex and romance to be a core
theme. Back in the 1980s there began a huge kawaii, or cute, craze which is the reason for the
strong presence of child or child-like characters (Zanghellini, 2009, p. 163). Attempting to
capitalize on the craze manga authors tried to showcase innocence as best they could usually
by creating very young looking characters as this was their idea of cute.  “Cuteness means a
generally more infantile character...” (Ripley, 2014) This unfortunately led to these types
of characters being portrayed in erotic manga and anime. This trope is still common in today’s
anime and it has grown even more strongly represented. This has led to an unfortunate
association for otaku culture.

Other examples of negative influence are the development of hikikomori and 2D Love. These
are often one in the same, but not always. There are people who view the characters of an
anime as actual friends or romantic interests and are actually able to derive all of their
social needs from anime. While this is not particularly harmful to any other people, it does
leave them with lessened relationships with their family and friends. The worse one is a
hikikomori. These are people who do not leave their home or do so very little. They avoid
interacting with other people and seek an indoor isolation. This lifestyle is able to be
maintained due to the prevalence of online occupations and food delivery. They are often
associated with anime, not just because they watch it, but because they need it for any
hope of social interaction. They are more often associated with online gaming though.
The good part is that most hikikomori are young people who are supported by their parents.
“...the average age for their withdrawal was 15” (Kremer, p. 2013). When that support is
cut off they are forced to venture out in order to sustain themselves.
