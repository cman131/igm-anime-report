Anime has been slowly spreading into the United States since AstroBoy opened the doors, but more recently there has
been a massive jump in its spread. This is something that would actually come as a significant surprise to very many
Japanese people from years ago and even some currently. This is because anime is not designed for foreign audiences (Drazen, 2003, p. vii-viii).
Anime is a very cultural creation at its base. It has been a way to teach children about life or entertain adults with
stories, but in Japan. The majority of anime was originally created for and by Japanese people. The issues associated with
globalization were never a concern as the potential for export was unthinkable. So when you see any of the older anime, you
may notice direct references to very Japanese centric culture points. You’ll also come across many references to Shintoism
and Buddhism, which are prominent religions that have become part of Japan’s culture.

If you were to watch some of the adapted anime of today and their raw versions, you would likely notice things that were taken
out, replaced, or censored by the distribution company. This doesn’t just relate to cultural and religious content though. Anime
also happens to contain a massive amount of raunchy and violent content which is often not considered suitable for open broadcast.
This is especially true for anime geared towards children and teens. The content is considered inappropriate for ages 17 and under
for american audiences, but is allowed in Japan. One of the most common gripes on this censorship is the American anime community
and their distaste for the “4Kids Entertainment” adaptations. The company has its name heavily associated with child level censorship
on imported anime. (GreatSaiyaman777, 2005) One of the most common references is to its adaptation of One Piece where blood is nonexistent,
cigarettes are lollipops, and fingers are a deadly weapon that should be feared. Nowadays the American distribution rights are owned by
Funimation Entertainment and the episodes have been released uncensored. (Funimation, 2007)
