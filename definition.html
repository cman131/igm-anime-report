Anime is a style of Japanese animation that has been developing since the early 1900s.
There exists a lot of dispute over what the first anime was. One example of this was the “Matsumoto Fragment.”
A man named Matsumoto Natsuki found an old tape reel that had been drawn on. When the reel was played, it showed
a short video of a boy writing “Pictures in Motion” on a chalkboard and then bowing. This tiny reel found itself
the center of attention for years, sparking debates on whether it was first and whether it can be considered anime
at all (Clements, 2013, p. 20-21). Despite the debates on what came first, the earliest anime success was 1918’s Momotaro (O’Connell, 1999).
Following its release anime sort of trickled upwards in popularity. There wasn’t too much of note in anime until later. The particularly
interesting change in anime after the 1940s was all due to the “God of Comics”, Osamu Tezuka. He was a medical student who ended up studying
disney animation. His manga was quite popular, but Japanese animation was given international recognition when he produced AstroBoy with his
animation company (Drazen, 2003, p. 5-6). Tezuka is still someone people know of today. Much of anime and manga is presumed or attributed to
having been influenced by his work.
