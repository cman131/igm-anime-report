		<p class="content-block">
Anime has now become a strong presence here in America despite its small roots placed here in
the 1960s. This came about thanks to the massive boom in distribution and popularity of anime
that came in the late 1980s and 1990s. There’s a very good reason that this growth happened
shortly after the American advancements in cable broadcasting that occurred in the 1980s. The
potential created by the multitude of cable channels and the new production ease of video cassettes
made distribution far simpler than it had been before. Along with this advancement in spreading
media, great shows such as Robotech, Sailor Moon, and the great Dragon Ball Z began to appear.

It is very hard to discuss the popularity of anime these days without bringing up Dragon Ball Z.
This show that started with the well received Dragon Ball. It enveloped the attention of America’s
youth. Kids and even some adults would wait in anticipation every Saturday evening to see the next
enthralling episode. Each episode was ranked at the top of the Nielsen charts (de, 2003). So many
people were captivated by this series and it was way more so than its predecessor. More than 16 million
copies were sold and merchandising garnered over 3 billion in sales (de, 2003). Dragon Ball Z burst
through the opening AstroBoy created leaving a gaping hole for anime to start pouring in through.

There are also merchandise driven anime that have immersed America through a connection between
real items and the fiction they present. The most notable instances of this are Pokémon and Yu-gi-oh!.
Pokémon started out as a set of video-games that appealed to the collector in people. This was later
expanded on with the release of the trading card game. In order to keep the merchandise popular and
selling, the anime was created. People delighted in the ability to recognize monsters in the show that
they had in card or game form. There was also a mass resurgence in the popularity of the games as folks
wanted to mimic the show’s main character. Each form served to boost the other two beautifully and The
Pokémon Company basked in success that remains stable today. On the other side Yu-gi-oh!, went in the
reverse approach. It started with the a manga being made into an anime, which steadily gained popularity.
Then, the card game was released and the franchise burst into success. They also later created some games
for Yu-gi-oh!, but they weren’t as popular as the show and card game.
