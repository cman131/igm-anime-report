To summarize, anime has been around for many years and has progressed significantly
since the 1900s. It has penetrated American media, first with AstroBoy and then further
with Dragon Ball Z. Its presence has become a strong one after entering despite poor attempts
at localization or censorship. Although some things derived from anime and its culture arenâ€™t
particularly beneficial, people have been able to derive a great many positive values, ideas,
and teachings as well.
