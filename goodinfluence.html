Once people are invested in anime, there are many teachings and morals that they will
likely pick up. One of the strongest themes taught to young children through anime is
the power of friendship. People are raised to believe that they can overcome anything
when working with their friends and family. This pushes them to create meaningful
relationships with other people and maintain them during their life. Some strong pushers
of this teaching are pet-based stories like Digimon and Pokémon. They show that the
creatures and their masters must work together to defeat evil or accomplish their goals.
Other teachings include an attempt at instilling confidence in one’s self and their abilities.
They’ll show a kid with a dream. All the odds will be stacked against them from the beginning, but
they’ll work hard putting in seemingly more effort than anyone else. Watchers will see the
character’s efforts prove fruitful at times and more commonly fail. However, the main point
being showcased is the character’s determination and confidence. When their efforts fail or
seem to have been wasted, they do not fall to depression or indifference. They pick themselves
back up and strive to work even harder. This theme is something that has been shown in many
variations of media from other countries as well, but in anime, particularly Shōnen, it is
conveyed strongly and often.
